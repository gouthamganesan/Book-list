# Book List

This project is a part of Traversy Media's Udemy Course. I just completed the section where we get introduced with the classes and sub classes. Brad's granular way of teaching is very paramount to the understanding of the classes in JavaScript. He explains how to implement in ES5 before introducing the "syntactic sugar" of the ES6 to make the students understand how it really works under the hood. This gave me a very good start about JavaScript's classes and prototype in general.

## Functionalities

### As of now

1. Can enter book name, author and ISBN value
2. Add the same to the UI
3. Submit only if all the values are present
4. Delete book entries
5. ES5 way of doing things
6. ES6 way of doing things
7. Local Storage functionality (in ES6)

### Next up

* Implement the local storage functionality in ES5

## Footnotes

I have used [Skeleton CDN](http://getskeleton.com) for making this project. Being a design freak, I can't stand bad design. Using skeleton lets me concentrate on the important concepts while making the UI presentable.
